## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- @face-font

### What I learned

flexbox is a great tool to place elements in a website, I used it to center the card by setting it in its parent ```.container```, same thing for the elements in the card as follows:
```css
  .card{
    width: auto;
    max-width: 20rem;
    height: auto;
    margin: auto;
    padding: 1.5rem;
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: column;
    gap: 1rem;
  }
```

### Continued development

I still need to focus on the different HTML5 tags and what CSS styles go with it. 

### Useful resources

- [How to center a div](https://builtin.com/articles/center-div-horizontally-and-vertically) - This helped me better understand how to use flexbox properties.
